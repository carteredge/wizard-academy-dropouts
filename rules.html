                    Conjuring lightning from your fingertips! Summoning skeletons to do your
                    bidding! Peering through time! These and more are things that you
                    absolutely sucked at! Alas, you were good enough to make it
                    <em>into</em> the Wizard Academy, but not good enough to make it
                    <em>out</em> with your degree in Wizarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wizard Academy Dropouts is a table-top role playing game (TTRPG) for two
                    or more players, one of which is the Headmaster (or HM) who runs the
                    game and the rest are the failed wizards (player characters or PCs).
                    Unlike most TTRPGs, the failed wizards are assumed to be both fairly
                    smart and fairly weak &mdash; standard nerds. Anything an average person
                    can do physically, they can also do. Anything that takes an above
                    average amount of strength or endurance, they automatically fail to do
                    unless they use magic. Similarly, they have all the wit and
                    genre-savviness the players can muster, and information about their
                    environment should be freely given
                    <em>unless</em> it pertains to magic. Everything else is accomplished
                    through <strong>casting spells</strong> and
                    <strong>knowledge rolls</strong> as described below.

                    the final report card they received before being expelled or dropping
                    out from the Wizard Academy. Give yourself two <strong>C</strong>s, two
                    <strong>D</strong>s, and two <strong>F</strong>s in the following
                    classes in their respective disciplines:

                            against an enemy as an action, dealing 1 damage to them. The enemy
                            must be within striking damage or you must have something potentially

                <h3 id="taking-turns">Taking Turns</h3>
                <p>
                    When the action gets intense enough that it&#39;s both unclear and important whose action goes
                    first, then it&#39;s time to take turns. Before the first turn, everyone rolls a
                    <strong>d6</strong>. If a character uses an action on their turn that requires a d6, they use the
                    result of this first d6. As such, the lowest roll goes first &mdash; someone casting a shorter spell
                    can blurt it out first. If a PC and an NPC roll the same result, the PC goes first &mdash; one
                    benefit at being so bad at magic is that they can throw caution to the wind and act hastily. If two PCs roll the
                    same result, they can decide among themselves which goes first. After the first turn, players keep
                    the same turn order and don&#39;t have to roll dice in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On your turn, you can move and take one <strong>action</strong>. An
                    <strong>action</strong> can be <strong>casting a spell</strong>, using an
                    <strong>item</strong>, or some other activity that you can perform within
                    a few seconds. You can also make a <strong>knowledge roll</strong> once on
                    each of your turns without using your action.
                </p>
                <h3 id="casting-spells">Casting Spells</h3>
                <p>
                    As a failed wizard, you are only good enough to cast simple spells. In
                    fact, you can only cast spells so simple that they can be described in
                    only a few words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To cast a spell, declare what <strong>wizard discipline</strong> you are
                    drawing from (see below), then roll a d6 then add the penalty or bonus
                    determined by your grade in that discipline on your final report card. You
                    describe your spell using a number of words equal to the number you rolled
                    or fewer. For instance, if you roll a 3, you could invoke a spell to
                    &quot;summon a key!&quot; or &quot;<strong>heal</strong> me!&quot; but not
                    &quot;summon key to that door!&quot; The spell then creates the effect you
                    described, although anything omitted from your description is left to the
                    Headmaster&#39;s discretion, at which point they should choose the most
                    hilariously disastrous option possible. If a failed wizard simply invokes
                    &quot;summon key!&quot; then it may simply summon the answer key to a test
                    (which may be the very sort of thing that got them expelled from the
                    Wizard Academy), or if a failed wizard invokes &quot;fire tornado!&quot;
                    they or one of their allies may end up trapped inside of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the result of your roll minus a penalty is <strong>0 or less</strong>, you still
                    <em>attempt</em> to cast a spell with a single word, but the HM can be
                    even less generous than usual in their interpretation of the results,
                    opting to misinterpret or even ignore the word you gave them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you attempt to cast a spell beyond your capabilities, it may produce a
                    similar but lesser effect. For instance, invoking &quot;Kill that
                    dragon!&quot; to try to kill a powerful, ancient dragon may simply
                    <strong>harm</strong> it.

                    If the HM determines that the spell you wish to cast doesn&#39;t match the
                    <strong>wizard discipline</strong> you chose to cast it, they can choose
                    to either penalize you with a worse effect or to reinterpret the spell
                    into a form that would fit the discipline you chose.

                <p>
                    The eight wizard disciplines are: <strong>Astromancy, Conjuration, Elementalism,
                    Enchantment, Illusion, Naturalism, Necromancy</strong>, and <strong>Transmogrification</strong>.
                    Your skill in six of these disciplines are represented as the grades on
                    your <strong>final report card</strong>. For each of these disciplines,
                    you have a bonus or penalty based on that grade as listed in the table
                    below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You left the academy before you could take any classes from the other two
                    disciplines, <strong>Astromancy</strong> and <strong>Transmogrification</strong>. Astromancy includes magic
                    involving space and celestial bodies and is most often used for predicting
                    the future or teleportation. Transmogrification is the magic of changing
                    living beings into other forms, such as turning yourself into a giant
                    spider. Your penalty to spells with these disciplines is always
                    <strong>-2</strong>.

                        When someone else casts a spell, you can use your reaction to try to
                        assist by channeling your magic into the spell or interfere with a
                        counterspell. You have one reaction and regain it at the start of your
                        turn.

                        When you channel your magic, roll a d6 and increase the number of words

                        spell to change its result.

                        each time something heals you, it increases your HP by 1. Similarly, if
                        you cast a spell to harm or heal, you deal 1 damage or heal 1 HP. When you
                        reach 0 HP, you fall unconscious, and the next damage you take kills you.

                        the desired words for the spell on the scroll. Casting the spell takes one
                        action and destroys the scroll.

                    When used, this scroll creates a magic doorway to a room of your choice in
                    the academy (except rooms where students are not allowed). Additionally,
                    when presented to a hall monitor, this scroll prevents them from becoming
                    hostile.
